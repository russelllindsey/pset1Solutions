The goal, as stated in the problem set specification:

C programmers (that would be all of us in this class) allocate and free memory explicitly. 
The good news about this is that we can write fast code for modern machines, because we 
have full control over memory. The bad news is that it's all too easy to write programs 
that crash due to memory problems. 
But wait -- there is more good news: As systems programmers, we can build tools to help us 
debug memory allocation problems. For instance, in this assignment, you will transform a 
simple memory allocator (e.g., implementation of malloc and friends) into a debugging memory allocator.
